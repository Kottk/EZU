# EZU
What does it do?

This API intends to make interfacing with a vehicle's ECU easier to do. Once you have established connection with an ECU, building messages and interpreting responses can be handled by the classes contained in this API. In it's current form this API only works with a JDM ECU for Subaru WRX STI MY '99/'00.


**TESTED WITH LEGACY '11 NON JDM ECU AND WORKS -- POTENTIALLY WORKS WITH ALL SUBARU POST '98**


What doesn't it do?

This API does not contain any tools that allow you to directly interface with an ECU. You will need to have the physical cable or BlueTooth unit to directly interface with your vehicle's ECU. You will also need to find a Serial Port communication API that you are comfortable using.

Developers:
Anthony Kottke and Sean Kirwan

**WARNING: MESSING WITH YOUR ECU MAY VOID WARRANTY/BRICK YOUR SYSTEM! PROCEED CAREFULLY!**
